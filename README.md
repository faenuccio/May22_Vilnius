# Formalising Mathematics

Repository for the May 2022 course on formalising mathematics at Vilnius University, wrapped around Kevin Buzzard's Jan-Mar 2021 EPSRC TCC course delivered to mathematicians at Imperial, Oxford, Bristol, Bath and Warwick (United Kingdom).

# Prerequisites

You should know some mathematics and you should not be afraid by basic logic statements, like and/or, contrapositive or arguments by contradiction. No knowledge of advanced topics (like topology, multivariable analysis or commutative algebra) is required.

# How to do the exercices

For each exercise session, click on the corresponding link below. You might have to wait for a minute or so until "Lean is busy..." becomes "Lean is ready!". Then, you can type exactly as I did in class. The only difference is that, instead of the nice "goals accomplished :tada: " you will see a more modest "no goals".
